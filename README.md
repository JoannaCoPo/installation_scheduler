# Installation Scheduler

### The Apporach:
Create an Object Oriented solution to this problem using Ruby
- leverage classes to create objects that interact to build a weekly PV installation schedule

### Edgecases, improvements, and tests with estimated times

### Refelctions
If I were to tackle this MVP again I would alter the way I approach the problem:
- I would have priortizied working out the most complex logic (buidling requirements) first and then refactored and broken the logic out into repective classes per responsibility, if time
	- if there wasn't time to time, I would include the intention when listing improvements, etc. 
	- eg. instead of starting by creating the Building class with the requirements, the weekly list of building could have included an object that specifies requirements
